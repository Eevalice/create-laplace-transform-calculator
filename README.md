This repository shows how you can access MATLAB速 from your Mathworks速 environment. With MATLAB Integration for Laplace Transform Calculator, you can integrate and solve MATLAB problems with an existing deployment, single user Mathworks速 Server, and many other Mathworks-based systems running in the cloud or on-premises.


## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Laplace Transform Calculator project with MATLAB速.

## Examples of Laplace Transform

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `live script`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `create function test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
